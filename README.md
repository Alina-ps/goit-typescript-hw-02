# Image Search Application

This image search application allows users to search and browse through a vast collection of high-quality photos using the Unsplash API. Built with a modern tech stack, the application leverages React for dynamic and efficient rendering of the user interface, and TypeScript to ensure robust, type-safe code.

## Features

1. **Search Functionality**:

- Users can enter keywords to search for images related to any topic. The application sends queries to the Unsplash API and displays a gallery of relevant photos.

2. **Responsive Design**:

- The UI is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

3. **Image Modal**:

- Users can click on any image to view it in a larger modal, with the image perfectly centered and scaled to fit within the modal dimensions.

4. **Load More**:

- Infinite scroll or a 'Load More' button allows users to load additional images without leaving the current view.
  
5. **Error Handling**:

- The application provides user-friendly error messages in case of network issues or invalid queries.

6. **Type-Safe Codebase**:

- TypeScript is used throughout the project to catch potential errors early in the development process, improving code quality and maintainability.
